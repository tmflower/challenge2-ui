# Star Mapper

This is the very silly outcome of a practice takehome project (https://github.com/tmflower/challenge2). 
It was a great opportunity to learn how to use Leaflet for the first time and play around with rendering map locations based on coordinates from the backend.
Challenging and fun!

## Acceptance criteria

Your application should have a frontend that displays a form and allows a user to input a favorite color, distance, origin and min and max age.
When the form is submitted, a map should render with markers for the location of the users found. 
You can use Mapbox, Leaflet or any provider for this functionality.

## Technologies used

- React/JSX
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
